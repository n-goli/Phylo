# Phylo

Collaboratively developed a Python-based research tool that allows evolutionary biologists to better visualize phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary pathways of 10+ mammalian species.
Designed a Python pipeline that retrieves 20+ public nucleotide sequences of species carrying the SLC25A6 gene from the NCBI Entrez database, aligns the sequences into a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using MUSCLE, and constructs phylogenetic trees using neighbor-joining methods.
Implemented ASCII tree outputs and exported the output tree in Newick format for downstream analysis.
